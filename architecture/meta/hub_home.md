# Hub & Home

Meta block group in `game/meta/` — hub navigation, day-pass system, storage, pawn shop, and the deferred selling / merchant surfaces that hang off the hub.

## Goal

Be the calm between runs: the place where the player converts won cargo into cash, spends cash on progression, and ticks the day forward. Success is a hub that frames every major meta system (knowledge, storage, selling, vehicles) without itself becoming a minigame.

## Reads

- `SaveManager.cash` — displayed in hub header (Balance)
- `SaveManager.storage_items` — hub header (item count) and storage scene source of truth
- `KnowledgeManager.get_mastery_rank()` — hub header (Mastery Rank)
- `GameManager.consume_pending_day_summary()` — `DaySummaryScene` input
- `KnowledgeManager.can_advance()` — Storage Unlock button gating

## Writes

- `SaveManager.current_day` / `cash` / `active_actions` — via `SaveManager.advance_days()` on Day Pass
- `SaveManager.storage_items` — mutated by Storage actions (queue research, queue unlock, sell)

On Day Pass: `GameManager.go_to_day_summary(summary)`. On Knowledge: `GameManager.go_to_knowledge_hub()`. On Next Run: `GameManager.go_to_location_select()`. On Pawn Shop: `GameManager.go_to_pawn_shop()`. On Storage: `GameManager.go_to_storage()`.

## Feature Intro

### Data Definitions

No resources owned by this block directly — Hub is a navigation surface over other systems' data. Runtime hook:

```gdscript
func _do_day_pass() -> void:
    var summary := SaveManager.advance_days(1)
    GameManager.go_to_day_summary(summary)
```

Merchant-related resource extensions are listed under their respective H3s below.

### Hub Scene

`game/meta/hub/hub_scene.gd` + `.tscn` — central navigation after each run and between day passes.

Header displays Mastery Rank, Balance, and Storage item count (refreshed by `_refresh_display()` on `_ready()`).

Buttons:

- **Next Run** → `GameManager.go_to_location_select()`
- **Storage** → `GameManager.go_to_storage()`
- **Pawn Shop** → `GameManager.go_to_pawn_shop()`
- **Van** → local `AcceptDialog` popup (`VanPopup`) showing van info
- **Knowledge** → `GameManager.go_to_knowledge_hub()` (see `knowledge.md`)
- **Day Pass** → `ConfirmationDialog` (`DayPassConfirm`) → on confirm, `_do_day_pass()` → `DaySummaryScene`

Returning from `DaySummaryScene` via `GameManager.go_to_hub()` re-runs hub `_ready()`, which calls `_refresh_display()` to update the header.

### Knowledge Hub Entry

`game/meta/knowledge/knowledge_hub.gd` + `.tscn` — navigation menu to three standalone sub-scenes: Mastery, Skills, Perks. Back returns to Hub. Full spec in `knowledge.md`.

### Day Summary Scene

`game/meta/day_summary/day_summary_scene.gd` + `.tscn` — standalone scene displaying day-advancement results. Used by both the hub Day Pass and the run-review continue flow. Reads a pending `DaySummary` from `GameManager.consume_pending_day_summary()`; if none is pending, returns to hub with a warning.

`DaySummary` (in `game/shared/day_summary/day_summary.gd`) carries `start_day`, `end_day`, `days_elapsed`, run-specific fields (`onsite_proceeds`, `paid_price`, `entry_fee`, `fuel_cost`), universal `living_cost`, and `completed_actions`. `net_change` is a computed property; `has_run_data()` gates the income group.

Displays: day header (`Day X` or `Day X → Day Y` when `days_elapsed > 1`), income group (visible only via `has_run_data()`), expenses (living cost, entry fee, fuel, paid price), completed actions list, net change, current balance. Continue → `GameManager.go_to_hub()`.

### Storage

`game/meta/storage/storage_scene.gd` + `.tscn` — player manages stored items: queue Market Research, queue Layer Unlock, sell.

- Unlock button disabled with reason tooltip via `AdvanceCheckLabel.describe()` when `KnowledgeManager.can_advance()` returns non-OK.
- Market Research button queues an `ActiveActionEntry`.

### Pawn Shop

`game/meta/pawn_shop/` — general-rate selling surface reachable from the hub. Accepts all categories (pawn-shop behaviour), backed by a `MerchantData` resource with an empty `accepted_super_categories`.

### Merchant Data (baseline)

`data/definitions/merchant_data.gd` — shipped resource describing merchants. Fields:

```gdscript
@export var merchant_id: String = ""
@export var display_name: String = ""

# Super-categories sold at the specialist rate (1.2–1.5×).
# Empty = pawn shop behaviour (accepts all at general rate).
@export var accepted_super_categories: Array[SuperCategoryData] = []

# Designer pool that special_orders is drawn from each Day Pass.
@export var special_order_pool: Array[ItemData] = []
@export var special_order_count: int = 2

# Perk gate. Empty = no gate.
@export var required_perk_id: String = ""

# Runtime-only: items currently on special order. Not serialised;
# regenerated each Day Pass by drawing special_order_count from the pool.
var special_orders: Array[ItemData] = []
```

`.tres` files live under `data/merchants/`. The pawn shop is one such merchant with empty `accepted_super_categories` and empty `special_order_pool`.

### Specialist Merchant _(deferred)_

_Hub surfacing and sell-rate logic not yet implemented._ Data schema already exists on `MerchantData` (see above). Still to do: hub button gating on `required_perk_id`, sell-rate multipliers (in-specialty 1.2–1.5× `sell_price`, out-of-specialty 0.8×, specials at 2×), and the `special_orders` refresh hook inside `SaveManager.advance_days()`.

### Merchant Personality _(deferred)_

Adds `personality_type: MerchantPersonality` enum and an `aggressive_factor` range to `MerchantData`. Affects counter-offer frequency, lock trigger threshold, and `special_orders` refresh rate.

### Garage Sell _(deferred)_

Another auction-type scene modelled on the existing `game/run/auction/` structure. No hard blockers — deferred to avoid scope creep on the selling flow.

### Own Shop _(deferred)_

Player lists items at a set price. Sell frequency scales inversely with ask price vs. market rate. Sale resolution ticks inside `SaveManager.advance_days()` alongside action ticking.

### Reputation + Scam Flow _(deferred)_

Reputation tracked per `merchant_id` (or faction) in `SaveManager`. Degrades on scam detection; affects sell rates and merchant access. Scam flow: player sells a misidentified or veiled item at inflated price. Three outcome branches — safe (no effect), post-payment discovery (large penalty), caught during trade (trade cancelled, moderate penalty). Detection probability via new `MerchantData.detection_skill: float` field.

### Expert Network (Appraisers) _(deferred)_

Appraisers narrow `knowledge_min/max` — see Notes for the open design question that blocks this.

### Bank / Bankruptcy _(deferred)_

Daily interest applied inside `SaveManager.advance_days()` after sale-side mutation and before living cost. Defines bankruptcy state and game-over condition. Optional loan UI in hub.

### Museum / Prestige _(deferred)_

Donation UI in storage scene, new `SaveManager` field for prestige state. See Notes for the design question that blocks this.

### Auction Modifier: All-Base-Layer Run _(deferred)_

Forces every item to display `layer_index = 0` regardless of player knowledge for an entire run. Requires a general auction modifier system design first.

## Notes

### Appraisers vs Market Research

Open question: appraisers currently narrow `knowledge_min/max`, the same outcome as Market Research. Decide whether they're a stronger version, or something distinct — reveal a specific layer without advancing it, permanently cached knowledge, or a one-off category points boost. Until this is decided, the Expert Network UI has no content to show.

### Prestige shape is undecided

Before building the museum donation path, decide: what does prestige unlock or affect (access tiers, price modifiers, cosmetics, pure achievement)? Is it per-super-category or global? These two answers determine both the `SaveManager` shape and whether the donation UI belongs in storage or is its own scene.

### Car system lives in `vehicle.md`

Hub is where vehicle selection and the car shop _surface_ (via the Van button / popup today), but the system doc is `vehicle.md`. This doc only references it.

### Reputation and scam flow must be designed together

Scam flow writes to reputation; severity thresholds determine outcome branches. Shipping one without the other produces either unhooked reputation data or an outcome system with no data to gate on.
