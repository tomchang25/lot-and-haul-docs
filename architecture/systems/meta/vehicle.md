# Vehicle System

Meta block in `game/meta/` — multiple car configs with different stamina caps, cargo grid sizes, fuel efficiency, and extra slot counts; player buys and selects cars at the Hub.

## Goal

Make the vehicle a meaningful cross-run investment: which car you drive should change how you run a warehouse, not just its stat sheet. Success is a progression arc from starter van to specialised rigs where each step changes packing strategy, action budget, and travel economics in felt ways.

## Reads

- `SaveManager.active_car_id` — currently selected vehicle
- `SaveManager.cash` — shop purchases
- `CarData` instances under `data/tres/cars/*.tres` — all selectable and purchasable vehicles

## Writes

- `SaveManager.active_car_id` — updated by the selection screen
- `SaveManager.owned_car_ids` — array of owned vehicle ids; appended on purchase
- `SaveManager.cash` — debited on purchase

On select: returns to `hub`. On purchase: stays in shop, refreshes owned/active state.

## Feature Intro

### Data Definitions

`CarData` — see `../run/cargo.md` for the full field list. Already consumed by `RunRecord` (`stamina_cap`, `fuel_cost_per_day`, `extra_slot_count`) and `cargo_scene` (`grid_columns`, `grid_rows`, `max_weight`, `extra_slot_count`). `SaveManager.active_car` getter currently returns the single active car via `CarRegistry`.

Added fields:

```gdscript
@export var trailer_damage_chance: float = 0.0    # probability each trailer item takes damage
@export var trailer_damage_ratio_min: float = 0.0 # minimum condition fraction lost
@export var trailer_damage_ratio_max: float = 0.0 # maximum condition fraction lost
@export var price: int              # cash cost at the car shop
@export var icon: Texture2D         # Hub + selection UI

func stats_line() -> String
# Returns: "Grid: CxR    Weight: W    Stamina: S    Fuel/day: F    Extra slots: E"
# Shared by CarCard and CarRow components.
```

Relevant `SaveManager` state:

```gdscript
var active_car_id: String              # already exists; stays authoritative
var owned_car_ids: Array[String] = []  # all cars the player has bought
var active_car: CarData                # computed getter via CarRegistry.get_car(active_car_id)
var owned_cars: Array[CarData]         # computed getter: resolves each owned_car_ids entry via CarRegistry
```

### Vehicle Hub

`game/meta/vehicle/vehicle_hub.gd` + `.tscn` — navigation menu with Garage, Car Shop, and Back buttons. Mirrors the Knowledge Hub pattern. Back returns to Hub via `GameManager.go_to_hub()`.

### Car Selection Screen (Garage)

`game/meta/vehicle/car_select/car_select_scene.gd` + `.tscn` — lists `SaveManager.owned_cars` as `CarRow` components. The active car shows a green "ACTIVE" label; others show a "Select" button. Selecting a car swaps the active state in place via `_refresh_active_state()` — no row rebuild, no navigation away. Back returns to Vehicle Hub.

`CarRow` (`game/meta/vehicle/car_select/car_row/car_row.gd` + `.tscn`) — `class_name CarRow`, extends `PanelContainer`. Follows the `setup()` / `_apply()` pattern with `is_node_ready()` guard. Displays icon, name, `car.stats_line()`, and toggles between `ActiveLabel` and `SelectButton` based on `is_active`. Emits `select_pressed(car)`.

### Car Shop

`game/meta/vehicle/car_shop/car_shop_scene.gd` + `.tscn` — lists all unowned cars as `CarCard` components. Inventory is "all cars in `CarRegistry.get_all_cars()` that aren't in `SaveManager.owned_car_ids`". Balance shown at top. Buy disabled when cash < price. On purchase: card removed, balance refreshed, remaining Buy buttons re-evaluated. Empty-state label shown when all cars owned.

`CarCard` (`game/meta/vehicle/car_shop/car_card/car_card.gd` + `.tscn`) — `class_name CarCard`, extends `PanelContainer`. Displays icon, name, `car.stats_line()`, price, and a Buy button. Emits `buy_pressed(car)`. Follows the standard `setup()` / `_apply()` / `is_node_ready()` pattern.

### Starter Car Authoring

3–5 `CarData` `.tres` files under `data/tres/cars/` spanning a clear progression — starter van → box truck → semi, or similar — varying cargo grid dimensions, `stamina_cap`, `fuel_cost_per_day`, `extra_slot_count`, and `max_weight`. The progression curve is the primary design lever; individual number tuning comes after the shop exists.

## Notes

### Location system ships first

The pre-run cost preview built during Location work will already be wired for `fuel_cost_per_day × travel_days` against the current single active car. When the vehicle shop lands, fuel variety slots into the existing cost card without rework — as long as the selection screen lands before (or alongside) the shop so the "active car" plumbing exists.

Vintage-vehicle restoration (auction parts → assemble → sell at car shop, with
select models becoming drivable) lives in its own doc: `../../drafts/features/vehicle_restoration.md`.
That system is separate from the work-vehicle loop covered here and is not
yet scheduled.

## Done

- [x] `CarData` resource with `car_id`, `display_name`, `grid_columns`, `grid_rows`, `max_weight`, `stamina_cap`, `fuel_cost_per_day`, `extra_slot_count`
- [x] `CarData` consumed by `RunRecord` (`stamina_cap`, `fuel_cost_per_day`, `extra_slot_count`) and cargo scene (grid + trailer slots + weight)
- [x] `SaveManager.active_car` getter returns the active `CarData` via `CarRegistry`
- [x] Add CarData to Yaml to tres
- [x] Add 4 `CarData` `.tres` files with distinct progression

- [x] `game/meta/vehicle/car_select/` scene — stat preview, sets `active_car_id`
- [x] `CarData.price` and `CarData.icon` fields
- [x] `CarData.stats_line()` helper — shared by CarCard and CarRow
- [x] `SaveManager.owned_cars` persistence; append on purchase; migrate existing saves to include the starter car
- [x] `SaveManager.buy_car()` — debit cash, append to owned_car_ids, save
- [x] `game/meta/vehicle/car_shop/` scene — browse purchasable cars, buy with cash
- [x] `game/meta/vehicle/vehicle_hub/` — navigation menu (Garage / Car Shop / Back)
- [x] `CarRow` component — `setup()`/`_apply()` pattern; in-place active-car swap without row rebuild
- [x] `CarCard` component — `setup()`/`_apply()` pattern; buy button with affordability gating
- [x] Hub: `VanButton` → `VehicleButton`; `VanPopup` removed; wired to `GameManager.go_to_vehicle_hub()`

## Soon

_None._

## Blocked

- [ ] Fuel cost surfaced in pre-run cost preview — blocked on Location system's cost card (see `../run/location_and_lot.md`)

## Later

- [ ] Car upgrades / mods (bigger tank, reinforced cargo bay)
- [ ] Durability and repair system
- [ ] Unique per-car perks (e.g. "+1 action per lot", "ignores first bad item")
- [ ] Sell-back value when trading up
